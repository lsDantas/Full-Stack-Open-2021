# Full Stack Open 2021

[Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) is a massive open online course offered by the University of Helsinki on modern full stack web development. The following repository contains my submissions for the exercises of the course. 

The program covers major web development technologies, including [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). Other lateral topics in contemporary web development as also considered such as [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
