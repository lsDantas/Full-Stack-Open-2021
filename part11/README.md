# Full Stack Open 2021
## [Part 11: CI/CD](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11)

Solutions for Part 11 are split into two repositories:

* [Full Stack Open Pokedex](https://github.com/lsDantas/full-stack-open-pokedex): A full stack app created by the engineering team at Smartly.io, but now with a brand-new CI/CD pipeline.
* [Full Stack Blogs App](https://github.com/lsDantas/Full-Stack-Open-Part-11): An integrated repository for the Blogs app built in Part 7, but now with a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

**Topics Considered:** Continuous integration and continuous deployment operations with GitHub Actions. Building effective pipelines that take into account linting, building, testing, packaging, and deployment. Effective repository management.
